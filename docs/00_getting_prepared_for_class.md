### FAQ
#### What is the different between "master" branch & "main' branch?
- "master" is old name and "main" is new name. The main branch has already replaced all new github repos as the main branch. You can read up on it [here](https://github.com/github/renaming). There is no actual difference between main and master, it's just the name of the default branch.
#### Can we use Visual Studio Code instead of GitPod Code?
- Yes, sure as you have installed git while using Visual Studio Code.
